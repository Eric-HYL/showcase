**Building_Energy_Efficiency_Register_Analysis**

My first Data Science project. I obtained the latest Building Energy Efficiency Register dataset through CKAN API, and analysed the energy efficiency of large office buildings over Australia. In addition, I did further study in SA buildings to find out the most energy efficient one.
In conclusion:
- Large office buildings over most states have similar energy efficiency. Although TAS has a significant higher result, the sample size is too small to judge.
- There is no significant difference in energy efficiency between SA large office buildings in CBD and outside CBD. However, a few buildings in the CBD consume a lot more energy per year.
- The energy efficiency of Australian large office buildings will not have a significant change any time soon.
